<h4>Notifications</h4>

The Notifications page displays notifications for events happening on the network.  Events include Supplier actions, system events and actions around third party apps.
For example, if a supplier accepts your invitation or publishes their profile or questionnaires, you will receive a notification. Notifications are generated to the roles that require them and are set by the Administrator for your company.  If you feel you are missing notifications, please contact support@trustyoursupplier.com. 
<br><br>
The table of notifications includes a listing of all notifications. Each notification has a date/time, a category and a Supplier name, if applicable. Clicking on a row will navigate you to the area of the system associated with that notification. From there you can review information or take action as needed.  
<br>Once clicked, a Notification will be marked as <i>Read</i> automatically. To manually mark a Notification as <b>Read</b> or <b>Unread</b>, use the checkboxes on each row, or the <i>Select All</i> checkbox and then click the <b>Mark as Read</b> or <b>Mark as Unread</b> buttons located above the table.  The <i>Select All</i> checkbox will check all Notifications on the page.

The notifications page is enabled with pagination feature for easy retrieval of records.
You can change the number of records displayed per page by selecting from the <b>Rows per page</b> drop-down and also navigate to a page using the Page Number drop-down selector at the bottom of the page. Use the Arrows to navigate to the <i>Next Page</i> or <i>Previous Page</i> to navigate between adjacent pages.
