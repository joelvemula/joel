<h4>Manage Users</h4>

The Manage Users screen allows the Buyer Administrator to manage all the users in their organization or company. The Administrator has the capability to
add new users and assign Roles which control permissions. The roles can be named/defined for each company, but
some examples include Administrator, Approver, or Buyer.

All the users are listed by default upon entering this screen. The table displays one user per row, with the key information shown such as Name, Email, Role, Status and Last Login Date.  Icons are available for various actions at the end of the row.
